Base Vulkan stuff
* Texture mapping
* Mip-mapping if low scope
* Before forking all this around - refactor init to eliminate unneeded nesting.

Pathtracer for 4d - 3d stopgap
* Compute shader to texture
* Compute shader ray trace with hardcoded scene description
* UBO(?) scene description

4d pathtracing
* Compute shader to voxel grid - all on the GPU
* Do it on a different timeline
* 4d pathtracing
* Basic scene
* Walk controls
* Control of 4d stuff via mouse look or something
* Finish game and whatnot

Pathtracer for monster maze
* Ray tracing extensions (research perf when not HW accelerated).
* Render directly to swapchain without any rasterization. 
* Hardcode scene example.
* Start generating.
* Pathtraced audio, taking advantage of simplicity of the maze environment.
* Finish game and whatnot
